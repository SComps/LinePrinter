# LinePrinter
Line printer application for simh and others

An application that reads printer output files from simh and other system emulators.

At this time, the application is in it's functional design stage supporting outfile files
from simh.  It is also capable of being a "print server" for applications such as hercules
that can print to a network address via telnet.

The code is not clean at this point, but it does work, and I'm sure it can be made much
more efficient.  If you've got any ideas, please feel free to contact me here or via
westdalefarmer@gmail.com.  Documentation is sparse, and the actual code itself has a fair amount of
dead code from my various attempts and experiments.  I'm feeling my way through this project.

Please let me know your thoughts on the project.
